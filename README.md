# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis



## Preprocessing Data for a Neural Network Model

- What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?

- What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?

- What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

## Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model

- How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?

- Were you able to achieve the target model performance?

- What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?

## Optimize the Model

### Add a third hidden layer
